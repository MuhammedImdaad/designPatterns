# SOLID

* S - Single Responsiblity Principle
    * class should have only one reason to change
* O - Open-Closed Principle
    * open for extension, closed for modification
* L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    * subtypes should be immmedietely substitutable for base types
* I - Interface Segregation Principle
    * avoid having larger interfaces, segregate if so
* D - Dependency Inversion Principle
    * a high-level module should not depend on low-level modules; both should depends on interfaces
    * abstractions should not depends on details; details should depend on abstractions
